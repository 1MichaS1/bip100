Files relating to Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 100 of Jeff Garzik as of 3 Sep 2015, but modified in these points:


1. 80% miner vote majority can cause a max. adjustment step of 10%,
   not 20% like BIP-100.

2. 60% miner vote majority can cause a max. adjustment step of 1.6%.
   BIP100 has no consequence foro 60% majority.

3. If there are no special votes, then a default increase of 1.09%
   per 2016 blocks (32.5% p.a.) takes place.
