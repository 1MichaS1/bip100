Files relating to Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 100 of Jeff Garzik as of 3 Sep 2015, but modified in these points:


1. 80% miner vote majority can cause a max. adjustment step of +/-10%
   (not +/-20% like BIP-100), i.e. up to factor x11.9 or x0.06 per year.

2. 60% miner vote majority can cause a max. adjustment step of +/-1.6%
   (BIP-100 has no consequence for 60% majority), i.e. -34% or +51% per year.

3. If there is no 60% or 80% majority vote for a block size limit adjustment,
   then a default increase of +1.09% per 2016 blocks (~2 weeks) takes place
   (+32.5% per year).
