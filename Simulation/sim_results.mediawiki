==Simulation results==

===Simulation 1 - New BIP===
Settings: Default parameterizstion of this BIP, i.e.:
* Without vote, the 2-weekly default up-step is +1.09% (yielding +32.5% p.a.)
* With a 60% vote majority, 2-weekly up/down-steps of up to +/-1.6% can be achieved (-34/+51% p.a.)
* With a 80% vote majority, 2-weekly up/down-steps of up to +/-10% can be achieved (x0.06/x12 p.a.)

The following simulation was carried out with mostly "default +1.09% adjustments", but some regularly occurring +1.6% or +10% adjustments, occurrence rate see histrogram:

The following simulation was carried out with 70% of "default +1.09% adjustments", and 30% of regularly occurring -1.6% adjustments, see histrogram:

===Simulation 2 - BIP100 Original (as of 3 Sept 2015)===
Settings: Parameterization like BIP100 original, with no BSL change by default:
* Without vote, the 2-weekly up-step is +0.0%
* With a 60% vote majority, 2-weekly up/down-steps of up to +/-0.0% can be achieved
* With a 80% vote majority, 2-weekly up/down-steps of up to +/-20% can be achieved (x0.003/x114 p.a.)

The following simulation was carried out with mostly "default 0.0% adjustments", but some regularly occurring +20% adjustments, see histrogram:
